## Introduction

eSearch is a :electron: rewrite of [Information-portal](https://github.com/xushengfeng/Information-portal.git) with many additional features.

The main purpose is to implement a **screen search** function similar to [Smartisan Big Bang](https://www.smartisan.com/pr/videos/bigbang-introduction) or [Xiaomi Portal](https://www.miui.com/zt/miui9/index.html) on Linux (also available on Windows and macOS), and it is also a convenient **screenshot software**.

After several iterations, eSearch's functionality has become more and more enriched.

Including **screenshot+OCR+search+translation+pasting+reverse image search+screen recording**.

## Testing

Tested successfully on ArchLinux, KDE plasma, Xorg.

Tested successfully on Windows 10 and Windows 11.

Tested successfully on macOS Catalina.

## Q&A

### Win7 and Win8 are no longer supported

Electron officially no longer supports Win7 and Win8, so eSearch no longer supports it either.

But you can compile it yourself, see [Documentation](./docs/use/qa.md#兼容性), some features may not be available.

### Download the dependency library

Most Windows will prompt you to download the dependent library after installation. This is because the screenshot library is needed. Clicking Download will automatically open Microsoft's official website for download. It may need to be restarted after installation is complete.

### No response when clicking on Gnome

Gnome users need to install the [appindicator](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/) plugin to use the system tray.

### mac alert file is corrupt

Mac has put some restrictions on dmg downloads from the Internet.

You can search for keywords such as "mac" and "file corruption" on the Internet. Different versions of the system apply different methods.

### Why choose electron

- The need for cross-platform support. I wanted to experience the excellent screenshot tools on Windows on Linux, and it's not good for Linux to be left out, so I chose cross-platform support.
- Qt relies on c++, and the learning cost is too high. Flutter for desktop is not yet mature. I am more proficient in js development.
- Screenshot relies on the local system, which is something current browsers cannot do.
- Ultimately, there is only one cross-platform solution similar to JavaScript. I chose the more mature and widely used electron.

In the case that other platforms do not have a separate package as a library like Arch Linux, the software occupies a lot of storage space, but the increase in dozens of js scripts is not much, but the functions brought are significantly felt, so I will try my best to give full play to its potential to achieve a more beautiful UI and richer features.

### Why is the installation package so big

In addition to the use of Electron, there are also onnx runtime libraries (used to run AI models), offline Optical Character Recognition models, screen recording portrait recognition models, object removal models for advanced editing, FFmpeg (used for screen recording format conversion, Linux has libraries so it is not included), etc.

### After updating, new errors appear that didn't exist before

This is generally due to the incompatibility of configurations in different versions. You can try to restore the default settings in Settings-Advanced-Advanced settings.

If the problem is not solved, please submit an issue.

## Development Reason

When I was using Windows, I always used the handy screenshot software: [Snipaste - Screenshot + Pasting](https://zh.snipaste.com/). But when I switched to Linux, Snipaste was not supported (in 2019, it is now supported), so I chose [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/), but unfortunately it does not have an intuitive color picker.

Another reason I developed eSearch is that I enjoy using the "Immediate Information Search" tool on my phone such as [Smartisan Big Bang](https://www.smartisan.com/pr/videos/bigbang-introduction) or [Xiaomi Portal](https://www.miui.com/zt/miui9/index.html), but I couldn't find a similar alternative on my computer.

So I simply developed my own "screenshot+OCR+search+pasting" software. I initially developed it with python+pyqt and created [Information-portal](https://github.com/xushengfeng/Information-portal.git), but because I am not familiar with pyqt, I switched to :electron: and developed this software. 😄
